Moreover, they can also remove the places from the list as well. There is is pricing and products page where details of the applications are written.(Not orignal details as the application is not production build.)

***Live Demo***: https://world-wise-by-rahim.netlify.app 

## Frameworks/Technology Used:

-> **React**

-> **Vite**

## Concepts Used to build application:

-> useState & useReducer hooks for State Management.

-> useEffect hook for necessary API calls.

-> useParams hook to get values from the URL.

-> useContext hook for better State Management and avoiding "Prop Drilling" issue.

## <- How to set up the Project? ->

-> Clone the repository either in your IDE or download the ZIP.

-> Once opened in your IDE, download 2 dependencies using the following commands:

    => **npm install json-server**

    => **npm install react-datepicker

    => **npm install react-leaflet leaflet**

-> There is a JSON file which will server as our dummy API. Open your terminal and type "npm run server" to start the dummy API.

-> Once dummy API is running, enter the following command to start the project: 

    npm run dev

-> The open the localhost link from the terminal and you are set to go.

# Note: 

You are required to download all the dependencies that I have mentioned above as they are an integral part of the application and without those the application will not function. In case of any query or issues, reach out to me using my social media links in my profile description. 

Happy CodingðŸ˜Š

# React + Vite:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
